    # How to use with AI (comment):
    # - Keep the full inventory in a CSV under /99_evidence/ and set source_file accordingly (e.g., 99_evidence/inventario_asset.csv).
    # - Prefer file names with underscores and a single dot only for the extension.
    # - When needed, provide the CSV content to the AI (or allow file read) and ask to populate only critical items here.
    # - Do not change enums or other sections; update only inventory.records.

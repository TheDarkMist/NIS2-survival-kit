# NIS2-Ready Documentation Toolkit for WordPress Micro-Businesses

## Purpose
This repository provides a **ready-to-use documentation framework** to help **WordPress micro-businesses and freelancers** start and maintain a **NIS2-compliant documentation corpus**.  
It is designed to be:
- **Simple**: usable without advanced technical skills.
- **AI-assisted**: works with AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) to create, update, and review documents.
- **Audit-friendly**: structured according to the 13 security measures identified by ENISA in its *Technical Implementation Guidance on Cybersecurity Risk Management Measures*.

## How the Repository is Organized

- **`/00_context/`** → General context and status tracking  
  - `index.md` – Human-readable list of all documents, their status, and last update date.  
  - `prompt_update_index.md` – AI prompt for updating the index.  

- **`/docs/`** → 13 folders, one for each ENISA security measure  
  Each folder contains:
  - Documentation files (policies, procedures, registers).  
  - Templates to help create new documents.  
  - AI prompts specific to that security measure.

- **`/reference/`** → Official NIS2 and ENISA materials  
  - PDF copies of relevant guidelines (digital text format, not scans).  
  - Short summaries and quick reference notes.

- **`/99_evidence/`** (optional) → Proof of compliance (reports, screenshots, logs).

## How Humans Should Use It

1. Open `/00_context/index.md` to see what is done, what is in progress, and what is missing.
2. Open the relevant `/docs/{area}/` folder and review or edit the documents.
3. Use the prompts inside each folder to:
   - Create a missing document.
   - Update an existing one.
4. When you change or create a document, **update `/00_context/index.md`** manually or with the help of AI using `prompt_update_index.md`.

## How AI Should Use It

When assisting a user with this repository, your first step is to get the project context.

1.  **Onboarding**: At the beginning of each work session, ask the user to provide the content of `/00_context/prompt_onboarding.md`. This will give you the full context of the project, your role, and the workflow.
2.  **Understand the Goal**: Once onboarded, listen to the user's request. They will point you to a specific prompt file in one of the `/docs/{area}/` folders.
3.  **Follow the Prompt Chain**: The specific prompt file (the "recipe") will instruct you to use the master prompt `/docs/_prompts/en/Create.md` (the "engine"). You must follow this chain, combining the context from the recipe and the algorithm from the engine.
4.  **Use the Company Profile**: Always read `/00_context/company_profile.yaml` to personalize the documents with the company's specific details.
5.  **Propose Index Updates**: After creating a document, remind the user that the next step is to update the master index. You can assist them using the rules in `/00_context/prompt_update_index.md`.

## Quick Start

1.  **Fill in Your Profile**: Before you begin, open `/00_context/company_profile.yaml` and fill in your company's specific details. This is crucial for personalizing the documents.
2.  **Start a Session with your AI**:
    -   Open your AI assistant (e.g., Cursor).
    -   Copy the entire content of `/00_context/prompt_onboarding.md` and paste it as your first message to the AI.
3.  **Create Your First Document**:
    -   Ask the AI to create a document using one of the specific prompts. For example: *"Please create the security policy using the prompt in `@docs/01_policy_network_and_systems/prompt_create_policy.md`."*
4.  **Review and Customize**: Check the document generated by the AI and make any necessary adjustments.
5.  **Update the Index**: Ask the AI to help you update the master index at `/00_context/index.md` by using the dedicated prompt for it.

Repeat steps 3-5 to incrementally build your NIS2 documentation.

## Design Principles

- **Clarity over complexity** – minimal technical barriers for micro-business users.
- **Contextual prompts** – each ENISA area has its own AI prompts to generate relevant content.
- **Modularity** – each folder can be used independently.
- **Source-based accuracy** – all advice and generated text should be consistent with `/reference/` materials.
